    "\n",
    "This course aims at an intermediate level Python programmer.  We will assume you already have some familiarity with basic Python constructs like importing libraries, writing classes, variables, flow control, and similar topics an introductory course will have addressed.  However, we do not assume an advanced level of knowledge, nor do we assume experience with the specific tools and libraries these lessons will address."

    "<img src=\"img/DQM-Millennium-Bridge-square.jpg\" align=\"right\" width=\"33%\"/>My name is David Mertz, and I am your instructor for these lessons.  I have been part of the Python community for over 20 years. During that time, I have been involved with the governance of the Python Software Foundation, and have worked as a developer, a writer, and a trainer.  In recent years I have  focused on Python's use in scientific computing and data science."

    "# Why Serialization?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several key purposes for which data serialization, and correspondingly de-serialization, are important.  In one case, we simply wish to be able to persist data from a running Python program to resume computation later on, still utilizing the same data.  At other times, we would like to exchange data with other tools and programs, perhaps ones written in other programming languages altogether.  Data, of course, comes in many shapes and sizes, and can be utilized for many purposes."

For the CSV lessons, we consider both the Python standard library and the popular third party library Pandas."
