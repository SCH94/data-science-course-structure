    "The *ElementTree* abstraction tries to find a compromise between an XML way of thinking and a Python way of thinking.  The Python standard library also comes with several other submodules for handling XML that are much closer to the XML way of thinking.  These include `xml.dom` (Document Object Model), `xml.sax` (Simple API for XML), and ` xml.parsers.expat`.  "

    "SAX and Expat are incremental stream-oriented parsers for XML, they both can be very fast and work incrementally. Both require quite a lot of boilerplate and are low-level. Expat is always non-validating, and can be blazingly fast.  The Document Object Model (DOM) creates an entire specialized object, with a variety of methods, as does ElementTree.  However, DOM is a standard created initially for JavaScript, and the method names are verbose, numerous, and feel out of place in Python.  Unless you need to closely match parallel code written in a language such as Java, JavaScript, or C#, I recommend against using the DOM approach."

    "If you want to work in a *more Pythonic* style with XML trees, the `lxml` library comes with an API called `objectify`.  This is based on much earlier work by my colleague Uche Ogbuji on Amara bindery and by me even earlier as `gnosis.xml.objectify`.  Neither of those old projects are currently maintained, but `lxml.objectify` is very similar and intuitive to work with.  In general `lxml` is a fast and well tested XML library, built on `libxml2` and `libxslt`, that provides both the `objectify` interface and an enhanced and faster version of `ElementTree`."
